sentence=Generic multi-button handler with debounce, short/long/double events, latching support, exact last-press duration, pluggable readers, enum-friendly API, optional time-source injection, and latch control APIs for global reset policies.
paragraph=Header-only Arduino library for handling multiple buttons with robust debounce; short/long/double classification; optional latching (toggle/set/reset driven by Short/Long/Double events); exact getLastPressDuration(); per-button overrides (timing—including double_click_ms—polarity, enable, latch config); reader callbacks for GPIO and expanders (e.g., MCP23017); and helpers (pressedMask/snapshot/forEach). Runtime setters include setReadFn/setReadPinFn, setGlobalTiming (alias setTiming), setPerConfig, enable, setActiveLow, and setTimeFn for FreeRTOS/hosted use. Includes latch control APIs (setLatched/clearAllLatched/clearLatchedMask) for system-level policies like global reset, plus GPIO, port-expander, cached-read, and latching examples.
