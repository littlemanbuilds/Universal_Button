sentence=Generic multi-button handler with debounce, short/long/double events, exact last-press duration, pluggable readers, enum-friendly API, and optional time-source injection.
paragraph=Header-only Arduino library for handling multiple buttons with robust debounce; short/long/double classification; exact getLastPressDuration(); per-button overrides (timing—including double_click_ms—polarity, enable); reader callbacks for GPIO and expanders (e.g., MCP23017); and helpers (peek/clear/heldMillis/reset). Runtime setters include setReadFn/setReadPinFn, setGlobalTiming (alias setTiming), setPerConfig, enable, setActiveLow, and setTimeFn for FreeRTOS/hosted use. Includes GPIO, port-expander, and cached-read examples.
